# Capstone Project - Working Title: Husband-Killer

**Rubric**
  1. How long should the game be?
      
    - Five minute playthrough for one branching path!
      
  2. How is our game being evaluated?
    
    - Following the script guidelines from previous workshops; create a world close to home and narrow in scope.
    - There should be an *emotional connection* created by the situation of the character from the start: challenge to address, problem to be solved.
    - Branches should offer significantly different directions for the story.
    - Game mechanic[s] should make sense in the world of the story; they should be relevant!!
